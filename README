This is the initial version of the neutro-api-cplane and 
neutron-openvswitch-cplane charm. The teting of the charms with 
openstach bundle is not done yet, but verified all the 
configuration that needs to be done in the neutron and nova
files are verified.

This contain the fix for juju-upgrade issue for neutron-openvswicth-cplane
charm. The issue was, at the time of deploying a br-ext interface is created.
But during upgrade its trying to create it again and it fails there.
So before upgrade it should clear the br-ext interface and then upgrade the
charm.

Also the new configuration that needs to be added to the nova-compute node
is implemented.

#Add the following lines to /etc/sysctl.conf
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 0
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 0
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
 
#run command to load kernel values
sudo sysctl -p

Added a new yaml file for bundle deployment "ceph_controller_cumpute_nodes.yaml"
command: juju deploy ceph_controller_cumpute_nodes.yaml

This bundle deployment file will deploy the ceph related service in one nodes, compute
services in another nodes and all other Openstack related service like neutron
glance, keystone etc in a separate node.
